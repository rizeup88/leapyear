## Description

This page includes a small entry bar that is presented to a user, which allows them to enter a four numbers to indicate a year, in order to determine if that year is a leap-year. Determining this relies on four business-logic equations that confirm whether or not the year is in fact a leap-year. Upon clicking "Find Out," the user will receive a message indicating if the year they entered either is, or is not a leap-year...

i.e.

• The program should return when a year is not a leap year.
	Input Example: 1993
	Output Example: false

• The program should return 'true' for years divisible by 4, since those are leap years.
	Input Example: 2004
	Output Example: true

• The program should return 'false' for years divisible by 100, since those are not leap years.
	Input Example: 1900
	Output Example: false

• The program should return 'true' for years divisible by 400, since those are leap years.
	Input Example: 2000
	Output Example: true
